  Hailo's person Re-Identification network is based on RepVGG_A0 and was trained in-house using several Person ReID datasets. It can work under various lighting conditions and numerous camera angles. 2 Models were trained independently - using 512 & 2048 embedding dimensions.
  
  ## Model Details

  ### Architecture (2048 / 512)
  * RepVGG_A0 
  * Number of parameters: 9.65M / 7.68M
  * GMACS: 0.89 / 0.89
  * Rank1<sup>*</sup>: 89.8% / 89.3%
<br>\* Evaluated on Market1501 dataset 
  
  ### Inputs
  - RGB image with various input sizes
    -  Image resize to 256x128x3 occurs on-chip
  - Image normalization occurs on-chip

  ### Outputs
  - Single embedding vector (2048 / 512 dim) per query
