  Hailo's license detection network (*tiny_yolov4_license_plates*) is based on Tiny-YOLOv4 and was trained in-house using Darknet with a single class. It expects a single vehicle and can work under various weather and lighting conditions, on different vehicle types and numerous camera angles.


  ## Model Details

  ### Architecture
  * Tiny-YOLOv4
  * Number of parameters: 5.87M
  * GMACS: 3.4
  * Accuracy<sup>*</sup>: 73.45 mAP
<br>\* Evaluated on internal dataset containing 5000 images

  ### Inputs
  * RGB image with size of 416x416x3
  * Image normalization occurs on-chip

  ### Outputs
  - Two output tensors with sizes of 13x13x18 and 26x26x18.
  - Each output contains 3 anchors that hold the following information:
    - Bounding box coordinates ((x,y) centers, height, width)
    - Box objectness confidence score
    - Class probability confidence score
  - The above 6 values per anchor are concatenated into the 18 output channels
