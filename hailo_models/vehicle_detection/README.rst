Hailo's vehicle detection network (\ *yolov5m_vehicles*\ ) is based on YOLOv5m and was trained in-house with a single class. It can work under various weather and lighting conditions, and numerous camera angles.

Model Details
-------------

Architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* | YOLOv5m
* | Number of parameters: 21.47M
* | GMACS: 25.63
* | Accuracy* : 46.0 mAP
  | \* Evaluated on internal dataset containing 5000 images

Inputs
^^^^^^

* RGB image with size of 1080x1920x3

  * Image resize to 640x640x3 occurs on-chip

* 
  Image normalization occurs on-chip

Outputs
^^^^^^^

* | Three output tensors with sizes of 20x20x18, 40x40x18 and 80x80x18
* | Each output contains 3 anchors that hold the following information:

  * | Bounding box coordinates ((x,y) centers, height, width)
  * | Box objectness confidence score
  * | Class probability confidence score

* | The above 6 values per anchor are concatenated into the 18 output channels
