# Retrain on Custom Dataset

This page will help you ramping-up your training environment for various tasks and architectures.
Each architecture has its own README which describes how to:
   1. Setup the environment using a compatible Dockerfile.
   2. Start the training process.
   3. Export your model.

> **Important**:  
    Retraining is not available inside the docker version of Hailo Software Suite. In case you use it, clone the hailo_model_zoo outside of the docker, and perform the retraining there:  
    ```git clone https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo_model_zoo.git```
