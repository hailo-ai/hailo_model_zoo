Hailo's license detection network (\ *tiny_yolov4_license_plates*\ ) is based on Tiny-YOLOv4 and was trained in-house using Darknet with a single class. It expects a single vehicle and can work under various weather and lighting conditions, on different vehicle types and numerous camera angles.

Model Details
-------------

Architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^


* | Tiny-YOLOv4
* | Number of parameters: 5.87M
* | GMACS: 3.4
* | Accuracy\* : 73.45 mAP
  | \ * Evaluated on internal dataset containing 5000 images

Inputs
^^^^^^

* RGB image with size of 416x416x3
* 
  Image normalization occurs on-chip

Outputs
^^^^^^^

* Two output tensors with sizes of 13x13x18 and 26x26x18.
* Each output contains 3 anchors that hold the following information:

  * Bounding box coordinates ((x,y) centers, height, width)
  * Box objectness confidence score
  * Class probability confidence score

* The above 6 values per anchor are concatenated into the 18 output channels
