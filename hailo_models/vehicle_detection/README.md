<br>

  Hailo's vehicle detection network (*yolov5m_vehicles*) is based on YOLOv5m and was trained in-house with a single class. It can work under various weather and lighting conditions, and numerous camera angles.

  ## Model Details

  ### Architecture
  * YOLOv5m
  * Number of parameters: 21.47M
  * GMACS: 25.63
  * Accuracy<sup>*</sup>: 46.0 mAP
<br>\* Evaluated on internal dataset containing 5000 images

  ### Inputs
  - RGB image with size of 1080x1920x3
    -  Image resize to 640x640x3 occurs on-chip
  - Image normalization occurs on-chip

  ### Outputs
  - Three output tensors with sizes of 20x20x18, 40x40x18 and 80x80x18
  - Each output contains 3 anchors that hold the following information:
    - Bounding box coordinates ((x,y) centers, height, width)
    - Box objectness confidence score
    - Class probability confidence score
  - The above 6 values per anchor are concatenated into the 18 output channels
